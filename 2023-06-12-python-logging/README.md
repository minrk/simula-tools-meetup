# Logging in python

In this meetup we will cover how to do logging in Python.

[01-simple](01-simple) will go through some simple usage of logger. In [02-namespaces](02-namespaces) we will go through how to use namespaces to configure loggers at different levels and how to set the level of loggers within the same namespace. This further extended to a package in [03-namespace-as-package](04-handlers-and-formatters) we go through how to set up handlers and formatters and finally in [05-configuration](05-configuration) we show different ways of configuring the loggers.
